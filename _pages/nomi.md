### [Czar czar](../projects/czar/)

Hello! I'm a PhD student focusing in saying no to new responsibilities. Unfortunately, this is a new area of research for me and I have failed thus far (hence how I have this czarship). When I'm not baking, hiking, reading a book a friend has forced upon me, cajoling people into taking on a czarship, or updating this website, I like to spend my free time doing research with Eshan Chattopadhyay in pseudorandomness.
