The Grad Seminar Czar organizes the weekly departmental Grad Seminar (formerly known as Student Brown Bag) lectures, a lecture series where students present their current research in order to share their work with other students in the department and help incoming students find research projects to work on. The Grad Seminar Czar finds students to speak, reserves the lecture room, and organizes lunch for the lecturer and attendees.
